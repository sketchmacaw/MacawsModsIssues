1.1.5

Changes:
- Garage Doors and Portcullis now require only to be placed on top, when clicked it will roll down
  until it hits a solid block. This way you don't need to build a 3x3x3 garage door but just 3 blocks
  wide on top. Also this removes the visible hitbox when they are opened, fixing mob pathfinding..
  !! If there are empty spots when you close the garage doors, just place any block like dirt there and break it..
- Added Tooltip to Garage Doors and Portcullis
- Garage Doors & Portcullis model Changed for the TOP opened variant
- Garage Doors use less states

Fixed Bugs:
- Mangrove Whispering variant missing from GUI
- Sound distance fading not working for Shoji, Jail, Garage Doors 
- When villagers open shoji doors it makes the normal door 
  sound instead of the custom sliding door sound
- Mobs not going through opened garage and portcullis
- Garage Doors block CC:Tweaked Turtle movement and water
- Garage Doors and Portcullis show strange blue tinted blocks
- Forge only: Fixed java.lang.ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException: Index 2048 out of bounds for length 1025
